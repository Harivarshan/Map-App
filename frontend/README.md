# London Property Plotter Frontend

React + Vite single-page app that renders a Leaflet map centred on London. It overlays the Westminster & Soho showcase polygon and requests property analytics from the Express + MongoDB backend, blending seeded examples with simulated insights.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite dev server (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`).
- `npm run build` – create a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.

Refer to the workspace root `README.md` for full-stack setup instructions and API details.
